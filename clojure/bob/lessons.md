# What did I learn?

I learned that intention revealing function names help clarify my code. Someone suggested that I could use full fledged module level functions, but I think that keeping them inside the `let` is better, seeing their limited usefulness.

Thanks to @rubysolo and @arr-ee for their kind comments.
